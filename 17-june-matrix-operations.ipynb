    "TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, provides various data structures to represent and manipulate data. Some of the commonly used data structures in TensorFlow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor: Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that represent the fundamental data unit in TensorFlow. Tensors can have any number of dimensions (rank) and are similar to numpy arrays. They can be used to store and operate on data, such as input features, labels, and model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a tensor\n",
    "tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable: Variables are mutable tensors that hold values that can be updated during training. They are commonly used to store and update model parameters, such as weights and biases. Variables can be initialized with an initial value and modified using TensorFlow operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a variable\n",
    "initial_value = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 3))\n",
    "variable = tf.Variable(initial_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset: The Dataset API in TensorFlow provides an efficient way to handle large amounts of data during training. It allows you to create input pipelines by loading and preprocessing data from various sources, such as files or tensors. Datasets are represented as sequences of elements, where each element can be a tensor or a tuple of tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",

    "dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "SparseTensor: SparseTensors are a specialized data structure for efficiently representing and manipulating sparse data. They are used when dealing with large tensors that contain mostly zero or empty values. SparseTensors store only non-zero values along with their indices, which helps reduce memory usage and computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a SparseTensor\n",

    "In TensorFlow, both constants and variables are used to represent and manipulate data. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n",

    "Immutability: Constants in TensorFlow are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once defined. On the other hand, variables are mutable and can be updated during training or optimization processes.\n",

    "Usage: Constants are typically used to store fixed values, such as hyperparameters, input features, or labels. They are useful for representing data that remains constant throughout the execution of a TensorFlow program. Variables, on the other hand, are commonly employed to store and update model parameters, such as weights and biases, during the training process.\n",

    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",

    "print(\"Updated Variable:\", variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) creates an immutable constant that holds the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Attempting to modify the constant using constant.assign([6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) raises an AttributeError because constants cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, tf.Variable(initial_value) creates a mutable variable initialized with random values. The variable can be modified using the assign() method, as demonstrated by variable.assign(tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 3))).\n",
